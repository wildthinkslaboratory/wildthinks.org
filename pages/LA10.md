**Theorem:**  Let $A$ be a square $n \times n$ matrix.  Then the following statements are equivalent.  That is, for a given $A$, the statements are eigher all true or all false.
- $A$ is an invertible matrix.
- $A$ is row equivalent to the $n \times n$ identity matrix.
- $A$ has $n$ pivot positions.
- The equation $A {\bf x} = {\bf 0}$ has only the trivial solution.
- The columns of $A$ for a linearly independent set.
- The linear transformation ${\bf x} \mapsto A {\bf x}$ is one-to-one.
- The equation $A {\bf x} = {\bf b}$ has at least one solution for each ${\bf b}$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$.
- The columns of $A$ span $\mathbb{R}^n$.
- The linear transformation  ${\bf x} \mapsto A {\bf x}$ maps $\mathbb{R}^n$ onto $\mathbb{R}^n$.
- There is an $n \times n$ matric $C$ such that $CA = I$.
- There is an $n \times n$ matric $D$ such that $AD = I$.
- $A^T$ is an invertible matrix.

Let $A$ and $B$ be square matrices. If $AB = I$, then $A$ and $B$ are both invertible, with $B= A^{-1}$ and $A= B^{-1}$.

**Definition:** A linear transformation $T: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ is said to be **invertible** if there exists a function $S: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ such that 
$$S(T({\bf x})) = {\bf x} \text{  for all } {\bf x} \text{ in } \mathbb{R}^n $$
$$T(S({\bf x})) = {\bf x} \text{  for all } {\bf x} \text{ in } \mathbb{R}^n $$
We call $S$ the **inverse** of $T$ and write it as $T^{-1}$.

**Theorem:**  Let $T: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ be a linear transformation and let $A$ be the standard matrix for $T$.  Then $T$ is invertible if and only if $A$ is an invertible matrix.  In that case, the linear transformation $S$ given by $S({\bf x}) = A^{-1}{\bf x}$ is the unique function satisfying the equations
$$S(T({\bf x})) = {\bf x} \text{  for all } {\bf x} \text{ in } \mathbb{R}^n $$
$$T(S({\bf x})) = {\bf x} \text{  for all } {\bf x} \text{ in } \mathbb{R}^n $$
