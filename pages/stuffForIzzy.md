Ooooh, color swatch!

// this is another way to write a depends function

// this is the new exportImage function that works
function exportImage() {

  // this function was taking too long.  Instead of waiting for this function to finish, it was 
  // going ahead and trying to write the imgData to the new tab.  But the data wasn't there yet.
  // This resulted in a blank page if the page was full resolution.
  // It doesn't happen at all on my computer because my CPU might be a little faster.
  const imgData = canvas.toDataURL("image/jpg");

  let x = window.open();

  // the solution is to wrap the display part of the function in a timeout function.  It will wait 1.5
  // seconds before running the display code.  This gives the canvas a little more time to return
  // the data.  There's probably a better way to do this with Promises and Asynch functions 
  // but we'd need to look up the right way to do it.
  setTimeout( function(params) {
    let [x, imgData] = params;
    console.log('opening tab');
    let iframe = "<iframe width='100%' height='100%' src='" + imgData + "'></iframe>"
    x.document.open();
    x.document.write(iframe);
    x.document.close();
  }, 1500, [x, imgData]);
}






// This is code to make drawing only happen 2 times per second
// add this and you can make drawing automatic anytime a color or setting is changed.

// add a variable that controls access to the draw function
let allow_redraw = true;


function draw() {

  // put this code at the beginning of your draw function

  if (!allow_redraw) { return; }   // if we don't have draw permission, return without drawing
  allow_redraw = false;            // if we're here we had draw permission, we're going to draw
                                   // so turn drawing off for after we finish our draw
  setTimeout(function() { allow_redraw = true; }, 500);  // after half a second turn draw back on

  // javascript allows functions to execute asynchronously.  That means that it will start 
  // the Timeout but will immediately go on to the rest of the draw function even though the 
  // Timeout hasn't finished.  The draw will likely finish long before the Timeout finishes 
  // and sets allow_draw back to true.  If draw is called again before the end of the first
  // Timeout, then the draw will just return without drawing since allow_draw will still be false.
