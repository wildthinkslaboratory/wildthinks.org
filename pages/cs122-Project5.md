# :::: step1
Make a folder in `cs122` called `p5` for your project files.  Then add the files 
- `lab5-factorial.py`
- `p5-guess.py`
# ::::

## Parts of Lab 5 passed in with Project 5


[step 2](::step2/button,transparent)
# :::: step2
# --partialborder factorial
Write a function that computes the factorial of a number.  Recall that $0! = 1$, and of factorial is undefined for negative numbers.
# --partialborder

- Your function should handle input errors.  
- Write a test function that iterates over a range of numbers and compares your function with `math.factorial` function, then prints results.
- Would be good to write a recursive version of this function as well as a loop based one.  He doesn't ask you to do this, but it's just the right thing to do.

#### Output
`test_factorial` output 

```
0 : 1 1
1 : 1 1
2 : 2 2
3 : 6 6
4 : 24 24
5 : 120 120
Errors (5): 0
```

[step 2](::step2/button,transparent)
# :::: step2
Comment out your testing code and add an input with prompt "Enter factorial number:". 

#### Output
```
Enter factorial number: 5
120

I think the Project 5 page is OK and doesn't need condensing.  Scroll down to where you find the blue 'Assignment' heading and begin reading there.
