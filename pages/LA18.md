**Theorem 4.7**  The Unique Representation Theorem
Let $$B = \{ {\bf b}_1 \ldots {\bf b}_n\}$$ be a basis for a vector space $V$. The for each ${\bf x}$ in $V$, there exists a unique set of scalars $c_1, \ldots , c_n$ such that 
$$ {\bf x} = c_1 {\bf b}_1 +  \cdots + c_n {\bf b}_n$$

**Definition**  Suppose $$B = \{ {\bf b}_1 \ldots {\bf b}_n\}$$ is a basis for $V$ and ${\bf x}$ is a in $V$.  The **coordinates of x relative to the basis** $B$ are the weights $c_1, \ldots, c_n$ such that ${\bf x} = c_1 {\bf b}_1 + \cdots + c_n {\bf b}_n$

If $c_1, \ldots, c_n$ are the $B$-coordinates of ${\bf x}$, then the vector in $\mathbb{R}^n$
$$\left[ {\bf x} \right]_B = 
\begin{bmatrix}
c_1 \\
\vdots\\
c_n
\end{bmatrix} 
$$ is the **coordinate vector of x (relative to $B$)** or the **$B$-coordinate vector of x**.  The mapping ${\bf x} \mapsto \left[ {\bf x} \right]_B$ is the **coordinate mapping (determined by $B$)**.

The vector equation 
$$ {\bf x} = c_1 {\bf b}_1 +  \cdots + c_n {\bf b}_n$$ is equivalent to 
$${\bf x} = P_B \left[ {\bf x} \right]_B$$  We call $P_B$ the **change-of-coordinates matrix** from $B$ to the standard basis in $\mathbb{R}^n$.

**Theorem 4.8**  Let $$B = \{ {\bf b}_1 \ldots {\bf b}_n\}$$ be a basis for a vector space $V$. The coordinate mapping ${\bf x} \mapsto \left[ {\bf x} \right]_B$ is a one-to-one linear transformation from $V$ onto $\mathbb{R}^n$. (a bijection between vector spaces is called an isomorphism)
