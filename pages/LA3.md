### Matrix Equations

A fundamental idea in linear algebra is to view a linear combination of vectors as the product of a matrix and a vector.

**Definition** If $A$ is an $m \times n$ matrix with columns $\bf{a}_1, \bf{a}_2, \ldots , \bf{a}_n$, and if $\bf{x}$ is in $\mathbb{R}^n$ then the product of $A$ and $\bf{x}$, denoted by $A\bf{x}$, is the linear combination of the columns of $A$ using the values of $\bf{x}$ as weights.
$$
A{\bf x} =
\begin{bmatrix}
{\bf a}_1 & {\bf a}_2&  \cdots & {\bf a}_n
\end{bmatrix} 
\begin{bmatrix}
x_1 \\
\vdots \\
x_n
\end{bmatrix} 
= x_1 {\bf a}_1 + x_2{\bf a}_2 + \cdots + x_n{\bf a}_n

**Theorem** If $A$ is an $m \times n$ matrix with columns $\bf{a}_1, \bf{a}_2, \ldots , \bf{a}_n$, and if $\bf{b}$ is in $\mathbb{R}^m$, the matrix equation
$$A{\bf x} = \bf{b}$$
has the same solutions as the vector equation
$$x_1{\bf a}_1 + x_2{\bf a}_2 + \cdots + x_n{\bf a}_n = \bf{b}$$
which in turn has the same solution set as the system of linear equations whose augmented matrix is 
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
\bf{a}_1 & \bf{a}_2&  \cdots & \bf{a}_n & \bf{b}
\end{bmatrix} 
$$

**Note:** The matrix equation $A\bf{x} = \bf{b}$ has a solution if and only if the vector $\bf{b}$ is a linear combination of the columns in $A$.

**Theorem** Let $A$ be an $m \times n$ matrix. Then the following statements are equivalent.
 - For each $\bf{b} \in \mathbb{R}^m$, the equation $A\bf{x}=\bf{b}$ has a solutions.

 - Each $\bf{b} \in \mathbb{R}^m$ is a linear combination of the columns in $A$.

 - The columns of $A$ span $\mathbb{R}^m$.

 - $A$ has a [pivot position](::pivot/tooltip) in every row.

A **pivot position** in a matrix $A$ is a location in $A$ that corresponds to a leading 1 in the reduced echelon form of $A$. A pivot column is a column of $A$ that contains a pivot position.

**Theorem** If $A$ is an $m \times n$ matrix, $\bf{u}$ and $\bf{v}$ are vectors in  $\mathbb{R}^n$, and $c$ is a scalar, then :
 - $A({\bf u} + {\bf v}) = A{\bf u} + A{\bf v}$

 - $A(c{\bf u}) = c(A {\bf u})$
