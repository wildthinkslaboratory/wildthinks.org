# Math 

### When
 **Register for Test** Manually register to take the test on September 6 at 11:00

 **Take the Test** Take the test on September 6 at a time of your choosing.

 ### Structure of the Test
 - 90 min timed test
 - 60 multiple choice questions
 - No calculus questions all precalc
 - A score above 40 is considered very good as long as you get enough of the trig questions correct

 ### How to prepare
 **first step** Put a reminder in your calendar for Septmber 6.

 **day 1**  Review this [list](https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/application/files/9716/2060/0419/AlgebraWorkshops.pdf) of algebra topics required.

 **day 2** Review this [list](https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/application/files/6616/2060/0418/Trig-Workshops1-4.pdf) of trig concepts you need to know.

**day 3** Take this [online practice](http://diagnostic.math.berkeley.edu/exam.php) test.  It will regenerate with new questions so you can take it more than once if you need more practice.

**day 4** Take these [practice tests]( https://mdtp-wri.ucsd.edu/practice_tests/index.php). You can just enter in uc davis and dummy information for the teacher and class period.  

**day 5** Take another practice test.


# Chemistry

### When
September 6-12


### Structure of the test

The test is using the ALEKS system.  It is the same as the one you used to take the math placement exam at the U of Oregon.  

The U of O math test was timed, but you could take as long as you needed.  I think the test adjusts and gives you harder questions when you answer correctly.  As a result there may not be a fixed time window and different people may take different amounts of time.

- 28 to take 4A a more rigorous treatment of material covered in CHE 2A, intended for students majoring in the physical sciences and engineering.
- 33 to take 2AH more rigorous treatment of material covered in CHE 2A. 



### How to Prepare

But the way to really do well is to study through the ALEKS program.  They have an online review course and it will match exactly what you need to know for the test.
