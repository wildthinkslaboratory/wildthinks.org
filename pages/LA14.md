### 4.1 Vector Spaces

Technically, $V$ is a **real vector space**. All of the theory in this chapter also holds for a **complex vector space** in which the scalars are complex numbers.

**Definition** A **vector space** is a nonempty set $V$ of objects, called *vectors*, on which are defined two operations, called *addition* and *multiplication by scalars* [(real numbers)](::footnote/tooltip), subject to the ten axioms (or rules) listed below. The axioms must hold for all vectors ${\bf u}$, ${\bf v}$, and ${\bf w}$ in $V$ and for all scalars $c$ and $d$.

- The sum of ${\bf u}$ and ${\bf v}$, denoted by ${\bf u} + {\bf v}$, is in $V$. (closure under addition)
 - $\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v} = \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{u}$ (Commutative)
 - $(\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}) + \mathbf{w} = \mathbf{u} + (\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w})$ (Addition is Associative)
 - There is a **zero** vector ${\bf 0}$ in $V$ such that $\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{0} = \mathbf{u}$ (Identity for Addition)
 - For each  ${\bf u}$ in $V$, there is a vector $-{\bf u}$ in $V$ such that $\mathbf{u} + (-\mathbf{u}) = \mathbf{u}$ (Inverse for Addition)
 - The scalar multiple of ${\bf u}$ by $c$, denoted by $c{\bf u}$ is in $V$. (closure under scalar multiplication)
 - $c(\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}) = c\mathbf{u} + c\mathbf{v}$ (Multiplication Distributes over Addition)
 - $(c + d)\mathbf{u} = c\mathbf{u} + d\mathbf{u}$ (Multiplication Distributes over Addition)
 - $c(d \mathbf{u}) = (cd)\mathbf{u}$ (Associativity for Multiplication)
 - $1(\mathbf{u})= \mathbf{u}$ (Identity for Multiplication)

Using only these axioms you can prove that the zero vector is unique and every additive inverse is unique.  You can also prove things like $0{\bf u} = {\bf 0}$ and $c{\bf 0} = {\bf 0}$.

In addition to the examples of vector spaces in $\mathbb{R}^n$ that you are used to, here are some less familiar examples.

**Example 3** Let $\mathbb{S}$ be the space of all doubly infinite sequences of numbers $$\{y_k\} = (\ldots, y_{-2}, y_{-1}, y_{0}, y_{1}, y_{2}, \ldots)$$ These type of objects arise in engineering and are called **signals** and can be used to represent discrete data that changes with time.  Think about how you'd show this is a vector space.

**Example 4** For $n \geq 0$, the set $\mathbb{P}$ of polynomials of degree at most $n$ consists of all polynomials of the form $${\bf p}(t) =  a_{0} + a_{1}t + a_{2}t^2 + \cdots + a_{n}t^n$$ You can also have infinite dimensional vector spaces which would include Taylor series expansions and Maclaurin series expansions.

**Example 5** Let $V$ be the set of all real-valued functions defined on a set $\mathbb{D}$.  (Typically $\mathbb{D}$ is the set of real numbers or some interval on the real line.)  Functions are added in the usual way: ${\bf f} + {\bf g}$ is the function whose value at $t$ in the domain $\mathbb{D}$ is ${\bf f}(t) + {\bf g}(t)$.
Likewise, for a scalar $c$ and an ${\bf f}$ in $V$, the scalar multiple $c{\bf f}$ is the function whose value at $t$ is $c{\bf f}(t)$.

**Definition** A **subspace** of a vector space $V$ is a subset $H$ of $V$ that has three properties:
1. The zero vector of $V$ is in $H$.
2. $H$ is closed under vector addition.
3. $H$ is closed under multiplication by scalars.

Consider the **zero subspace** which is the set containing only the zero vector from a vector space $V$.  Show that this is a subspace.

# --outlinebox
**Theorem 4.1:**  If ${\bf v}_1, \ldots, {\bf v}_p$ are in a vector space $V$, then 
$$\text{Span}\{ \mathbf{v}_1, \ldots, {\bf v}_p \}$$ is a subspace of $V$.
