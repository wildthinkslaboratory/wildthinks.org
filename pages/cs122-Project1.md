- When you create files for your homework, use the exact name specified for files, directories and variables(if specified). 
- Your program should produce the exact output specified (small differences in number of spaces won't matter).  

As expected, computer scientists use a computer program to grade their students papers.  It will run everyone's code and check that their output matches.  If your names are different or your output uses slightly different text it won't pass these tests even if your answer is correct.

#### Question 1
You will be attending a family reunion, and the reunion coordinator wants you to bring watermelons for everyone. The coordinator stated that 150 people will attend the reunion, and 70 of the 150 will be children. The coordinator asks that you plan on two slices of watermelon for each adult, three slices for each child, with 25% extra for those that want more than the planned amounts. Each watermelon on average will produce 14 slices. You need to calculate the total number of watermelons, rounding up to the next highest count of watermelons.
# --partialborder

#### Solution
Take the following lines of code and insert them into `p1.py` in the proper order and places to solve Question 1.

```
import math

slices_per_adult = 2
print("Total slices (including extra):", total_slices)
children = 70
total_slices = total_slices + (total_slices * extra)
print("Total watermelons (rounded up):", watermelons)
slices_per_watermelon = 14
total_slices = (children * slices_per_child) + (adults * slices_per_adult)
print("Total slices:", total_slices)
watermelons = math.ceil(watermelons)
slices_per_child = 3
watermelons = total_slices / slices_per_watermelon
extra = 0.25
print("Total watermelons:", watermelons)
adults = 80
```

#### Output
Your code should produce this output.
```
Question 1
------------------------------------------
Total slices: 370
Total slices (including extra): 462.5
Total watermelons: 33.035714285714285
Total watermelons (rounded up): 34
```

#### Question 2
Your friend was bragging about how many stairs he climbed each day because of his apartment location on the fourth floor. Calculate how many times your friend would have to go down then back up the stairs to reach his fourth floor apartment to reach 50, 100, 200 and 500 steps. The apartments all have vaulted ceilings, so use 14 steps per floor in your calculations. Remember to count down and back up as one trip. You will also reuse the variable that contains the target number of steps. Round up.
# --partialborder

#### Solution
Write a program that solves this problem and put it in `p1.py` in appropriate place.
**Notes:**
- Module `math` has a function `math.ceil()` that rounds a float up.
- Assume the building has a ground floor and the next floor is the first floor.
- Use the following variable names `steps_per_floor`, `floor`, `target_steps`, and `trips`

#### Output
```
Question 2
------------------------------------------
Trips for 50 steps: 1
Trips for 100 steps: 1
Trips for 200 steps: 2
Trips for 500 steps: 5
```

#### Question 3
Your friend worked over the summer on a farm and one of his tasks was to check the irrigation. The farm used a circular stationary irrigation system (also know as center pivot irrigation), and one of your friend's tasks was to walk around and inspect the edge of the irrigation zone. Despite the obvious fitness advantages, your friend thought he'd walked over a hundred miles a week. Did your friend walk over a hundred miles in a single week?

According to your friend, each center pivot system has a radius of 200 feet. The farm had six center pivot systems, and your friend would inspect each system twice a day, five days a week. 
# --partialborder 

#### Solution
Write a program that solves this problem and put it in `p1.py` in appropriate place.
**Notes:**
- Module `math` has a constant `math.pi`.  
- `math.round()` will be helpful.
- Your final answer variable must be named `weekly_distance`

#### Output
```
Question 3
------------------------------------------
Weekly distance (feet): 75398.22
Weekly distance (miles): 14.28
```
