### 4.3 Linearly Independent Sets; Bases

An indexed set of vectors $$\{ {\bf v}_1, \ldots , {\bf v}_p \}$$ in $V$ is said to be **linearly independent** if the vector equation
$$c_1{\bf v}_1 + c_2{\bf v}_2 + \cdots c_p{\bf v}_p = {\bf 0}$$ has *only* the trivial solution $c_1 = 0, \ldots, c_p = 0$. The set is said to be **linearly dependent** if the equation above has nontrivial solutions.

**Theorem 4.4** An indexed set of vectors $$\{ {\bf v}_1, \ldots , {\bf v}_p \}$$ of two or more vectors, with ${\bf v}_1 \not = {\bf 0}$, is linearly dependent if and only if some ${\bf v}_j$ (with $j > 1$) is a linear combination of the preceeding vectors.

**NOTE:** The main difference between linear independence in $\mathbb{R}^n$ and in a general vector space is that when the vectors are not $n$-tuples, the homogeneous equation $$c_1{\bf v}_1 + c_2{\bf v}_2 + \cdots c_p{\bf v}_p = {\bf 0}$$ usually cannot be written as a system of $n$ linear equations.  That is, the vectors cannot be made into the columns of a matrix $A$ in order to study the equation $A{\bf x} = {\bf 0}$.  We must rely instead on the definition of linear independence and on Theorem 4.4.

**Definition** Let $H$ be a subspace of a vector space $V$.  An indexed set of vectors $$B = \{ {\bf b}_1 \ldots {\bf b}_p \}$$ in $V$ is a **basis** for $H$ if $B$ is a linearly independent set, and
$$H = \text{Span } \{ {\bf b}_1 \ldots {\bf b}_p \}$$

The book gives some examples of **standard basis** for some vector spaces.  They are sort of obvious but the term **standard basis** is not precisely defined. Page 213.

**Theorem 4.5** Let $$S = \{ {\bf b}_1 \ldots {\bf b}_p \}$$ be a set in $V$, and let $$H = \text{Span } \{ {\bf b}_1 \ldots {\bf b}_p \}$$.
	- If one of the vectors in $S$, say ${\bf v}_k$ is a linear combination of the remaining vectors in $S$, then the set formed from $S$ by removing ${\bf v}_k$ still spans $H$.
	- If $H \not = \{ {\bf 0} \}$, then some subset of $S$ is a basis for $H$.
